# Request information worker

# Installation
You should install [rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) (I prefer wrangler v1 but you should also be able to perform the next steps with wrangler2).  
After your [wrangler configuration steps](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler#-config), you should be able to publish the tool with
```bash
wrangler publish
```
